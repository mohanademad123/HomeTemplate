Excited to share my project! 

I’ve built a Home Sales E-commerce Platform 🏡that simplifies finding your dream home! Using modern web development tools, I aimed to create a sleek, responsive, 🚀 and engaging user experience.

Here’s a glimpse of the Tools I Used:

✨ Technologies & Libraries:

HTML5 & CSS3 for a clean, structured layout

JavaScript for dynamic features & smooth interactivity

WOW.js for impressive on-scroll animations

Swiper.js to create beautiful, responsive sliders

Typed.js to enhance the header with real-time, animated typing effects

💡 Highlights:

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices

Smooth Animations for engaging user interaction

Modern UI: Optimized for a smooth user journey
